in the first part of this assignment I made a loop where a star rotates continously. In the second loop I made the colors randomly change and also updapted the star to a shape that I liked better. In the third part of this assignment I made a pattern with a random function. Finally, I transfered my data into  make both the rectangles and the stars arrays. Thank you very much for reading this!
