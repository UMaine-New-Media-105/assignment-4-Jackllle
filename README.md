in the first part of this assignment I made a loop at the bottom to creat bushes. In the 2nd part of the assignment I made another loop to create trees. In the third part of this challenge, I created A guy behind the tress, as well as, a loop to creat the branches of the tree. In the Fnal part of this assignment I changed my tree branches into an array.
